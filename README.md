# Encryption-Decryption

My 5th project from Hyperskill.

This program allows user to encrypt or decrypt the text from an input or a file, using alphabet-shifting or unicode-shifting algorithms.

Supported console parameters:
- -mode     "dec" for decryption, encryption by default;
- -data     uses the folowing text as source;
- -alg      "unicode" for unicode-shifting algorithm, alphabet-shifting algorithm by default;
- -key      uses the folowing integer as a shifting value, 0 by default;
- -out      uses the folowing path to create a file with the result of the program's execution;
- -in       uses the folowing file as a source, ignored if -data exists.
